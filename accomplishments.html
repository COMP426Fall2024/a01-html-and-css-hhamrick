        <h2>Slaying the Gorgon Medusa</h2>
        <p>To appease Polydectes and save his mother from marriage, Perseus went on a quest for Medusa's head. He gained many tools along the way like winged sandals and a bronze shield. He snuck up on Medusa and beheaded her while she was sleeping. He kept the head in a bag as it still had the power to turn others into stone.</p>

        <h2>Saving Andromeda</h2>
        <p>After being slighted by the queen, Poseidon sent a sea monster Cetus to destroy Aethiopia. The princess Andromeda was chained to a rock, waiting to be sacrificed to the monster Cetus. Perseus saw this and promised the King that he would save her. He slew the monster using Medusa's head to turn it to stone, and married Andromeda shorty after.</p>

        <h2>Killing Polydectes</h2>
        <p>Polydectes mistreated and harrased Danae, upset that she would not marry him. After hearing about this Perseus stormed into Polydectes' palace and found the king and his attendents in the middle of a feast. Perseus took out Medusa's head from his bag and turned Polydectes into stone. After this Perseus made Dictys king in place of his petrified brother</p>
