                    <li>To prevent this, Acrisius locked Danae up in a chamber with no doors so that she would never have any children</li>
                    <li>Zeus grew fond of Danae, appeared to her in the form of golden rain, and impregnated her</li>
                    <li>After Perseus was born, Acrisius locked Danae and the child in a wooden chest and threw the chest in the ocean</li>
                    <li>The chest washed up safely on the island of Seriphos, and Perseus was saved by Dictys and grew up under his care</li>
